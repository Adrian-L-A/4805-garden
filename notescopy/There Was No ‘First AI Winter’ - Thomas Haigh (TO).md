- Early AI as a branded effort to receive funding for computer science departments, but before too long was an important actual area of study.
- Haigh explains that the ‘First AI winter’ (a period of downturn in AI research) is an oversimplification and that AI research continued in this period.
- Despite some high-profile setbacks, several areas of AI research continued to develop during this period.
- Decreases in AI funding were more to do with unrealistic expectations of specific projects while other areas of AI research continued to have significant funding.
- Miss characterisation of framing technological history around binary narratives of success and failure when progress is small and incremental in reality.
- Haigh seeks to correct the record and explain that there was not a halt of AI in the 70s but rather there are periods of optimism, recalibration, and gradual process.
