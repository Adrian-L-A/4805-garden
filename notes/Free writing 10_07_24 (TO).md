AI in the News.
- articles tend to fall into one of two camps consistent with the 'Two War Visions of AI' reading, those being the 'accelerationists' and the 'doomers'.
- When looking at some of the news outlets in Canada we see articles looking at the potential benefits of AI in the prevention of wildfires in Alberta. We also see the more 'doomer' discourse around AI and the potential risks that they pose.
- Looking at the news around AI today also shows that former Google CEO Eric Schmidt says we should abandon our climate goals and focus on AI. This ties back into the reading titled 'The TESCREAL Bundle' where one quote from my notes stand out and is fundamentally opposed to Eric Schmidt's view "by urging researchers to work on defined tasks for which we can develop safety protocols, rather than attempting to build a presumably all-knowing system such as AGI".
