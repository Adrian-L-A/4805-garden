- AI was a key component in the emergence of computer science as an academic discipline.
- The modern computer was once viewed as a thinking machine as well.
- Lots of biological comparisons within early computer science: Gates called neurons (because they thought neurons were like binary switches), parts called organs, storage units called memory
- The term AI was first coined in 1955 at Dartmouth College.
- “AI was defined not by the first claims that computers could think like brains but the first assertions that only specific, hard-to-program, activities like learning, forming concepts, manipulating language, or demonstrating creativity should be counted as thought. This was a retreat from the radical idea that every digital computer was already thinking”.
- AI grew alongside the discipline of computer science and has been an aspect of research as long as computer science had existed.
- The domain of what was artificial intelligence shrank as things, like planning routes and playing chess were able to be done without ‘intelligence’
- AI-inspired breakthroughs in computing theory, algorithms, and hardware, while advancements in computer science provided the tools and platforms needed to explore AI concepts.
