Ai should be used as a supplemental tool, not a full replacement for workers and original human thinking and interaction.

Many believe that it should completely replace human experiences

AI can be used as a tool that provides new insight into collections held by the GLAM sector, such as recognizing colonial , gender , and racial bias.

AI could also be used to find information that is not apparent to humans, recognize patterns, as well as sort through information in a fraction of the time it would take a human researcher.

New perspectives on AI and its usages need to be talked about more than simply its utilitarian use: Who does it affect? Who needs to be at the table when decisions regarding AI and its data are made? What image is the media producing when speaking on AI? What happens to the data when the project ends?

AI is inherently bound to the dataset that one uses to inform it, it cannot recognize anything outside that, as illustrated by Elwes' art exhibit, demonstrating it could not recognize bodies in drag.
