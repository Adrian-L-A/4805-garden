Computer systems - a confusion of map and territory

- A question of semantics and understanding. 
	The issues brought forward in Karawynn [[Long_Reading]] "Language Is a Poor Heuristic for Intelligence" about seeing language = intelligence, the social dynamics at play and the historical value of it. 

- What happens when we drop the 'artificial' in 'artificial intelligence' 

- We place too much significance on the latter part of the name, and equate that with understanding/reason/feeling. 
	Language is extremely powerful, and the nuances are seemingly at the heart of all AI/LLM discourse.

- If the systems and models are the map, what is the territory? What is the ground level experience to bring comprehension on such a large scale now that AI is spreading so quickly?
