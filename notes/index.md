- Name your files along the pattern `your-initials-MainNoteIdea-year-month-day.md`
- If you want to link to a note already existing, you just need to visit the note and copy the filename; then you can write the link in markdown like so: `I like [this idea](smg-ExampleNoteFile-2023-11-22)`.

2. Click on the 'notes' folder
3. Drag-n-drop your notes onto that folder.
4. Hit the commit button.
