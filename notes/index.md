[[building a site with this template|detailed instructions about building a website with this template]]

- Write your notes as text files, and save them as .md.
- Name your files along the pattern `your-initials-MainNoteIdea-year-month-day.md`
- If you want to link to a note already existing, you just need to visit the note and copy the filename; then you can write the link in markdown like so: `I like [this idea](smg-ExampleNoteFile-2023-11-22)`.

To contribute your own notes:

1. Fork this repo - [right-click here, open in new window](https://github.com/shawngraham/4805-garden/fork)
2. Click on the 'notes' folder
3. Drag-n-drop your notes onto that folder.
4. Hit the commit button.
5. Make a pull request to me.

We will walk through this in class a few times so you get the hang of it.
