I need to look into how open-source "AI" Models are being used, what are other people using them for? How can I use them for my particular ideas? I would like to refresh myself on the ai models that we used throughout the term

I like the idea of identifying unknown authors, how would one "quantify" a writing style? Look into stylographic uses of AI and how they are identifying authorship.

What points am I going to use for quantification?

This is a limitation of the idea: To show that this is feasible, I would need to find a document that the authorship of which is unknown, but its authorship needs to be in contention. I need to have potential authors whose known work can be compared with said document.

- it needs to come from a period where there are potential authors to draw from, it can't be a solution to everything. This is another limitation, it can't be applied to antiquity or any work where there are no known potential authors.

I can train a model on various works of an author, and then feed it the document whose authorship is unknown, and then if it leans more towards one author than another, then I will know its working.

Maybe it would be easier to train an individual model on the works of one person, and then a different model on the works of another person.

For the sake of this project, maybe it is a good idea to pick Lenin's Testament. This is because it has several theorized authors that have published works:

- Vladimir Lenin
- Leon Trotsky
- Nadezdha Krupskaya

After a quick google search, I found that the published works of all of these authors are easily accessible. Pulling pdfs of the various works of each of them should not be a problem.

Perhaps similar to the experiment we did last semester with the biography of Benjamin Franklin, I could feed the model various documents and have it identify ideas, objects, places, etc., that each of these authors mentioned frequently, and then run Lenin's testament through it.  The model could find that each of these authors are more likely to use certain words, have different writing structures, use various adages, and ideas. This is an idea worth exploring.

Perhaps I could train a model on each of these writers, and through quantification of their writing styles, it could generate a probability or analyze the similarity of *Lenin's Testament* to works produced by these other authors purely on writing style. I have already found an article of interest for quantification of writing styles.  "Quantitative Analysis of Literary Style" published in *The American Statistician* authored by Peng & Hengartner, 2002. However this source is over 20 years old, and while it definitely still has value, it will be worth looking into more recent sources. In this article, Peng & Hengartner explain that they have devised equations to allow a writing style to be quantified and plotted on a graph, allowing one to see overlaps between various writing styles.

Alternatively, Dr. Graham suggested that this idea could be applied on a larger, less-specific scale. It could be used to analyze writing differences over time. Perhaps looking at journals from throughout a particular century.

With this idea, one could feed an LLM journal entries of regular citizens and analyze the differences over time and space. What problems did regular people face over time? Does this correspond with known major historical events? (probably, but it would be interesting to potentially plot historical events down on a timeline and see how regular citizens felt over time, also what changes by geographic location?)
- As an example, the generally accepted date of the beginning of the French Revolution is in 1789. Would an LLM be able to analyze the differences over time? Could it pick up on various themes, and see how they potentially boiled over by 1789?
- I can understand french, so there would not be a need to translate documents. However an issue may arise regarding the handwriting of the documents, and whether or not pdfs exist. This might require more digging and legwork than I initially believed.
- Perhaps the French national archives or Archives Nationales de France.
